model_thinking
==============

A UML activity diagram containing decision points for the application of different models.

I created this diagram after following the excellent [course](https://class.coursera.org/modelthinking-005) by [Scott E. Page](http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~spage/) on [Coursera](http://http://coursera.org/).

The diagram is based on my notes and the excellent mind map from [Vasily Ryzhonkov](http://slideshare.net/VRyzhonkov/ryzhonkov-vasily-model-thinking-mind-maps-02042012).

To edit the diagram use [UMLet](http://www.umlet.com/), a lightweight and cross-platform UML tool.
